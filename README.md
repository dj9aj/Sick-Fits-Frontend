# Advanced-React

Project Objective - 

React is the first frontend JavaScript framework that I've worked with. So far I've been blown away and love working with React on a daily basis as a professional developer. With a strong desire to learn more and dig deeper into the world of React, I decided to invest in Wes Bos' Advanced React course. The result is a Full stack application with GraphQL, and a Node backend.

GraphQL - 

GraphQL has been a buzz lately and I was keen to give it a try. It's essentially an alternative to the way in which REST APIs work. In contrast to hitting an API endpoint, where you just accept the data that's returned to you, GraphQL allows you to write queries on the client side and gives you the freedom to specify the exact data in the shape that you want returned from the server. It is not a framework, and probably better described as a specification to be implemented by whatever language that you wish to work with. For example, if you're working JavaScript, there will be a library to interface with GraphQL. It requires buy-in from both the client and server side.
I've deployed the React app via Heroku - https://sickfits-jack-react-prod.herokuapp.com
